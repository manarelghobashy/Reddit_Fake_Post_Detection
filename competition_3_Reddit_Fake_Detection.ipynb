        "-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "#### Q1:What is the difference between Character n-gram and Word n-gram? Which one tends to suffer more from the OOV issue?\n",
        "Character n-gram is a contiguous series of n characters from a given sample of text or speech, whereas word n-grams is is a contiguous series of n words from a given sample of text or speech, and the one who will suffer from the out-of-vocabulary issue is word n-gram\n",
        "* Character n-gram\n",
        "  * Character n-grams are found in text documents by representing the document as a sequence of characters.\n",
        "  * Character n-grams have proven to be of high quality for authorship attribution.\n",
        "  *Character n-grams are including whitespaces and punctuation.\n",
        "  * example, a character 4-gram model results in the following tokens: [It], [It_i], [t_is], [is], [is_a], [s_a_], [_a_s].\n",
        "* word n-gram\n",
        "  * Word n-grams are found in text documents by representing the document as a sequence of words.\n",
        "  * example, a character 1-gram model results in the following tokens: [hello], [like], [eat].\n",
        "  \n",
        "* The word is OOV. An Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) Word is a Linguistic Unit or a token that does not appear in training vocabulary or document.\n",
        "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "### Q2:What is the difference between stop word removal and stemming? Are these techniques language-dependent?\n",
        "Both, Are the most important preprocessing techniques for text, but the main difference is that the stop word removal totally remove some predefined words that it knows from the sentence and have a list of these words, in other hand, stemming is about to reduce the word and return it to its root, like removing suffix and prefixes not removing the whole word, ex (playing -> play), etc, both are language dependant stop words in English not like in German and vice versa also the grammars in English not like in the German language.\n",
        "* stop words:\n",
        "  * Stop words are a set of commonly used words in a language. Examples of stop words in English are “a”, “the”, “is”, “are” and etc.\n",
        "  * Stop words are commonly used in Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to eliminate words that are so commonly used that they carry very little useful information.\n",
        "* stemming:\n",
        "  * Stemming algorithms work by cutting off the end or the beginning of the word, taking into account a list of common prefixes and suffixes that can be found in an inflected word. Examples of stemming in English are \"studies\" when we use the stemming it will be \"studi\".\n",
        "* the stop words and the stemming are language-dependent.\n",
        "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "### Q3: Is tokenization techniques language dependent? Why?\n",
        "* yes, tokenization is dependent on language. Each language can have various linguistic rules and exceptions. Languages such as English identify token boundaries via whitespace and punctuation, but other languages such as Chinese require a more complex segmenter to extract tokens from a stream of text that does not contain any whitespaces.\n",
        "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "### Q4: What is the difference between count vectorizer and tf-idf vectorizer? Would it be feasible to use all possible n-grams? If not, how should you select them?\n",
        "* count vectorizer used to convert a text into a vector-based on the frequency (count) of each word that appears throughout the text, whereas tf-idf vectorizer it divides into two parts TF which is refer to term frequency where we count how many time that the word appears in the text and then dividing it by the total numbers of words in the whole text, where IDF is about taking the logarithm to the previous result to decrease the weight of a common word in the sentence or document, it wouldn't be feasiable and it would be np-complete problem,but you can select them by using some of search method techniques like (Grid search, random search).\n",
        "* The time it takes to create the count. Vectorizer is much lesser as compared to your hashing function or the tf-idf representation.\n",
        "* CountVectorizer: Counts the frequency of all words in our corpus, sorts them and grabs the most recurring features (using max_features hyperparameter). But these results are mostly biased and our model might loose out on some of the important less frequent features. These are all boolean values. Ex. SEO People used to take advantage of this.\n",
        "* TFIDFVectorizer: TFIDF is a statistical measure said to have fixed the issues with CountVectorizer in some way. It consists of 2 parts, TF (Term Frequency) multiplied with IDF (Inverse Document Frequency). The main intuition being some words that appear frequently in 1 document and less frequently in other documents could be considered as providing extra insight for that 1 document and could help our model learn from this additional piece of information. In short, common words are penalized. These are relative frequencies identified as floating point numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Would it be feasible to use all possible n-grams? If not, how should you select them? \n",
        "* No, This will make it very difficult to assign likelihoods that capture the target of our analysis.\n",
        "* it will depand on the model and i will try different n to decide the best n. because If we consider a chunk size of n=2, our results include “The reporters,” “the President,” “the United,” and “the room.” While not perfect, this model successfully identifies three of the relevant entities as candidates in a lightweight fashion.\n",
        "* On the other hand, a model based on the small n-gram window of 2 would fail to capture some of the nuance of the original text. For instance, if our sentence is from a text that references multiple heads of state, “the President” could be somewhat ambiguous. In order to capture the entirety of the phrase “the President of the United States,”\n",
